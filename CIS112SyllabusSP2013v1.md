###Montgomery County Community College###  
Computer Science III: Data Structures & Algorithms  
CIS 112 NC  - 3 Credits - Spring 2013  
Lecture & Lab - PH 311  
10:10 am to 12:05 pm, Monday & Wednesday  
Instructor: Jason Wertz (jwertz@mc3.edu)

### Course Description ###

Building on the concepts learned in CIS 111B, the fundamental concepts of data structures and algorithms are explored. This course will apply software engineering techniques to the design and implementation of programs that manipulate complex data structures. Effective software engineering methods are stressed as well as developing good programming style. A high-level compiler language such as Java or C++ will be used. This is the third course for computer majors.### Prerequisites ###CIS 111B with a “C” or better, or equivalent object-oriented programming experience.### Required Texts and Lab Manuals ###Main, M. (2011). _Data Structures & Other Objects Using Java (4th ed.)_.  Prentice Hall.### Learning Goals ###1.	Demonstrate the application of fundamental data structures including stacks, queues, linked lists, hash tables, trees, and graphs.2.	Explain principles of software engineering for designing and implementing programs with emphasis on algorithm analysis and top-down design using good programming style, and documentation.3.	Design and implement programs that demonstrate understanding of fundamental computing algorithms such as binary search trees, depth-first traversals and breadth-first traversals.4.	Demonstrate fundamental algorithmic strategies such as brute-force, divide and conquer, backtracking, branch-and-bound and pattern matching.5.	Apply software validation and debugging methods including plan test creation and test case generation.

### Learning Activities ###Lecture, discussion, hands-on lab exercises, homework assignments, group projects, research assignments, quizzes and exams. ### Sequence Of Topics (Course Calendar) ###All topics, readings, and scheduled activities subject to change.

### Grading ###* 50% - Quizzes, Projects, Lab & Homework Assignments  	* 10% - Class Participation/Attendance  			* 20% - Midterm  * 20% - Final  				A = 93 – 100   A- = 90 – 92   B+ = 87 – 89   B = 84 – 86   B- = 80 – 83   C+ = 77 – 79   C = 70 – 76   D = 60 – 69   F < 60

### Attendance/Withdrawal Policy ###
You are allowed 3 absences without penalty. Absences 1, 2, and 3 will have no effect on your grade. Absence 4 will reduce your attendance grade by half and absence 5 will reduce your attendance grade to zero. Absence 6 has no penalty but absence 7 will result in an automatic F for the course. Any student missing more than 6 classes will receive an automatic F for the course regardless of the work completed. You will automatically receive a 0 for any graded assignments conducted on days that you are absent including quizzes and tests. You can not make-up any in-class work, quizzes, or tests that you miss when you are absent.

### Late Work Policy ###
All work is due within 48 hours of the date posted. This means you can hand an assignment in up to 2 days late with no penalty. After the 2 day grace period each assignment will lose 10 points for each day it is late.Work will not be accepted more than 12 days after the original due date (2 free days plus 10 days of losing points). The extra days are yours to manage. You don't need to ask to use them. It is your responsibility to manage your time appropriately. 

### Academic Honesty and Student Conduct ###

Academic Student Code of Ethics – “In the pursuit of knowledge and scholarship, all members of the academic community at MCCC must maintain a constant commitment to academic integrity.  The College provides an environment that fosters critical thinking and judgment, and in order to safeguard the integrity of the institution, students are expected to follow the policies of the College and the faculty. To fulfill their part of that commitment, students must adhere to an academic code of ethics by refraining from participation in acts of academic dishonesty. By attending MCCC, students accept this Student Academic Code of Ethics and agree to the following:            

* Students must do all of their own work. * Students must not cheat. * Students must not help others to cheat. Students who are unclear about the validity of an academic procedure they are about to undertake should ask their instructor for guidance beforehand. Violations of this code of ethics will result in sanctions, including possible dismissal from the College.”   (See complete Code of Ethics in catalog, Student handbook or [online at http://www.mc3.edu/gen/polpro/st_acad_code_of_ethics.html](http://www.mc3.edu/gen/polpro/st_acad_code_of_ethics.html))Students are expected to conduct themselves in a specific manner as a member of the MCCC community. Please refer to the student code of conduct/civility in the student handbook for more information.### Accommodations For Students With Disabilities ###
