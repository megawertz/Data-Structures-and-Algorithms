### Reading & Lectures ###
Review Chapters 1 & 2 to refresh your Java skills.

* Pages 1-4 (up to but not including Section 1.1)
* Chapter 2 on general Java programming. You should be comfortable with the majority of what is being discussed in this chapter.

Check out my Java video lectures on [iTunes University](http://itunes.apple.com/us/institution/montgomery-county-community/id428484757). These were recorded some time ago but they are still relevant to the material.

### Next Week ###
* Continue reviewing chapter 2
* Read the remainder of chapter 1
* Review chapter 13

### Week 1 Assignment (Java Review) ###
Complete program number 4 on page 96 of the textbook for next class. You must use radians for the angle as that is the unit of measure expected by the cos() and sin() methods. If you think better in "degrees" there are helper function in the Math class to do the conversion.

[Some reading on radians!](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/Mathematics/geomath/trignb/deg.html)

When you are done with number 4 move on to problem number 5 and implement the line segment class that uses the class you created in the previous assignment.
