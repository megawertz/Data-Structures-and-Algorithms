### Week 4 Assignment (Basic List Operations) ###
Chapter 4 discusses linked lists using the IntNode class. You can use the pre-written IntNode class provided by the book or you can rewrite the class as you read the chapter. I believe rewriting the class will help you better understand how the class operates but the option is up to you.

Utilize the IntNode class in Chapter 4 to perform the following tasks.

* Prompt the user to enter anywhere from 5 to 10 values and store them in a linked list.
* Using the values stored in your linked list, perform the following operations.
	* Print out the average of those numbers.
	* Print out the smallest and largest items in the linked list.
	* Copy all of the items in the linked list to an array.
	* Print out those numbers in reverse.
