Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
==============================

This repository contains the syllabus and course materials for CIS 112 - Data Structures and Algorithms at Montgomery County Community College.

This repository is a work-in-progress and will represent the full course as I teach it by May of 2013...I'm refining and building this repo as I go this semester (Spring 2013).
