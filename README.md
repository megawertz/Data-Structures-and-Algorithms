Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
==============================

This repository contains the syllabus and course materials for CIS 112 - Data Structures and Algorithms at Montgomery County Community College.

##Notes##
* This repository does not contain presentation materials, lecture notes, code generated during class discussion, and sample code. These resources are only available to students enrolled in this course for now.
* This course currently uses a traditional textbook. In the future I have plans to transition this course to reading materials that are available through Creative Commons or other Open Source licenses. If you have any suggestions please contact me.
* This repository is a work-in-progress and will represent the full course as I teach it by May of 2013...I'm refining and building this repo as I go this semester (Spring 2013).
